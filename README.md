# Parametric Designs With Cadquery

You can find a few parametric design here, each model is a result of my own need. So they are just functional, not fancy. However you're welcome to make them fancier maybe more functional.

# How To ?

You need to have cadquery install on you system, CQ-editor is a nice to have tool to visualize and play with the models.

Check [CadQuery Documentation](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more information or any other installation problem. I highly recomend following cadquery documentation and running a few samples.

Install the cadquery along with other dependencies I have used in model scripts:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Well the rest is easy... just run the python script!

# Models

## [pBox](PBOX_README.md)

Simple box you can generate to stome small things, not suggested in large sizes, or adjust the hidden parameters and make it work.

## [pIVAR](PIVAR_README.md)

Parametric box desing with lid, on which you can put some texts, for IKEA Ivar shelf. Hang(able) to Ivar shelf beams.
